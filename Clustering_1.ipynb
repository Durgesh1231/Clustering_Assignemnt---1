        "# Q1. What are the different types of clustering algorithms, and how do they differ in terms of their approach and underlying assumptions?\n",
        "# Answer:\n",
        "# There are several types of clustering algorithms:\n",
        "# 1. **K-means clustering**: Partitional clustering that divides the dataset into K clusters. Assumes that clusters are spherical and equally sized.\n",
        "# 2. **Hierarchical clustering**: Builds a tree-like structure of clusters, either agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down).\n",
        "# 3. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**: A density-based algorithm that forms clusters based on density and can detect noise (outliers).\n",
        "# 4. **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**: A probabilistic model that assumes data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions.\n",
        "# 5. **Mean Shift**: A non-parametric clustering algorithm that finds clusters by shifting to regions of higher density.\n",
        "\n",
        "# K-means is different from others as it assumes spherical clusters, is sensitive to initial centroids, and works well with convex shapes and large datasets.\n",

        "# It works by:\n",
        "# 1. Choosing K initial centroids (randomly or based on some heuristic).\n",
        "# 2. Assigning each data point to the nearest centroid based on a distance metric (usually Euclidean).\n",
